  * The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
  * The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored permanently on the back end.
  * The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.
* 25 points – Your app has a high-quality design and implementation.
  * For example, your app is free of bugs and has an effective user interface.

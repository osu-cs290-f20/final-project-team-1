Deadline 1 Requirements ↴
## Brainstorming project ideas  
  * A high-level description of the application’s “purpose”.
  * A high-level picture of the application’s appearance/visual design.
  * A high-level overview of the data you’ll need to store to power the application.
  
## Deliverables and submission
Once you’ve done the above things draft a brief document containing the following things:

  * The names and OSU email addresses of all of your final project team members.
  * For one or two project ideas, write a brief description of the application you’d implement, including the following things (an example of what this might look like is included below):
    * One or two sentences describing the “purpose” of the application.
    * A very rough sketch of the application’s appearance/visual design. This doesn’t have to be fancy.
    * You could draw it on a napkin and snap a photo of it with your phone. A brief list of the data you’ll need to store to power the application.



Once you’ve created that document, save it as a PDF and submit it under the appropriate assignment on Canvas before the deadline listed above. You only need to submit one copy for your entire team.

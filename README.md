  <li>The names and OSU email addresses of all of your final project team members.</li>
  <li>For one or two project ideas, write a brief description of the application you’d implement, including the following things (an example of what this might look like is included below):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>One or two sentences describing the “purpose” of the application.</li>
    <li>A very rough sketch of the application’s appearance/visual design. This doesn’t have to be fancy.</li>
    <li>You could draw it on a napkin and snap a photo of it with your phone. A brief list of the data you’ll need to store to power the application. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

Once you’ve created that document, save it as a PDF and submit it under the appropriate assignment on Canvas before the deadline listed above. You only need to submit one copy for your entire team.
